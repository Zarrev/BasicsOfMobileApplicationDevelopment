I wrote the code in Xcode's playground and there the running was succesfully and everything was good (I checked it many times), but when I tried to run my program on the website (http://online.swiftplayground.run/) then I got Terminated by signal 6. I don't understand why.

Xcode 4.2+ is required for the error free building and running.

(When I took out the 170. and 177-180. lines then the webpage has worked too, please tell me if you know what is the "problem" with it)
